	  <p class="lead"><strong>Project: FoodConnect, 1st place for the Second Harvest Food Charity</strong></p>
  	  <p class="lead">An awesome hackathon at Brainstation Toronto for charity. Me and my team worked with the Second Harvest food charity to build FoodConnect; a cool little app that connects food volunteers with donors in real-time, Uber-style. Considering that food charities currently coordinate meetings between volunteers and donors with clipboards, our idea was a vast improvement and we ended up winning first place! </p>

	  <p class="lead">An awesome hackathon in Philadelphia that I went too! Alongside my amazing team, we built an virtual reality android app that simulates severe visual impairement (like colourblindness, glaucoma etc.) The purpose of our app was to raise awareness and generate empathy for those affected so that we may raise money for research into these awful diseases.</p>

	  <p class="lead"><strong>Project: Kampus Hacks, 2nd Place Overall</strong></p>
	  <p class="lead">My very first Startup weekend/Hackathon experience, and the one that triggered my hackathon addiction. I formed a team with complete strangers and we came up with an idea that we thought was so cool; what if we could make an app that could transcribe and summarize our lectures for us, so we could sleep in class? And so we started planning, designing and finally, coding. We were the only team that coded until 5 am in the morning, long after most teams had called it a night. Our hard work payed off when we won 2nd place and over 10,000$ in prizes! Not only that but me and my team-mates really liked working with each other and we thought the idea had potential so we continued working it. To this day, I still work on this idea on the weekends.</p>
